CIRTESU Blueboat Simulation Package

This repository contains a comprehensive Stonefish library specifically developed at CIRTESU (Castellón). It is designed to provide a high-fidelity simulation environment for the Blueboat surface vehicle across various realistic scenarios within the CIRTESU facilities.
Description

This package integrates all necessary configurations, physics models, and assets to operate the Blueboat robot. Our goal is to provide highly detailed and complete scenarios that replicate the actual conditions at CIRTESU, allowing for robust testing of navigation algorithms, sensor fusion, and control strategies before deployment in real waters.
Key Features

    High-Detail Scenarios: Custom-built environments replicating the specific geography and obstacles of CIRTESU.

    Blueboat Integration: Pre-configured Stonefish actuators and sensors tuned for the Blueboat surface vessel.

    Ready-to-use Launch Files: Streamlined setup to get the simulation running in seconds.
